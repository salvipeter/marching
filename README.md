# Minimal marching cubes tessellation
Uses [my geometry library](https://github.com/salvipeter/libgeom/) for handling points/vectors and meshes.

## Installation
The ugly table of 256 cases is generated by a Scheme program - run `gentable.sh` before building by CMake (requires Gambit Scheme or Guile).

## Usage
There is a single function documented in the header file.
See also the example program in `mc-test.cc`, which generates the objects shown below.
